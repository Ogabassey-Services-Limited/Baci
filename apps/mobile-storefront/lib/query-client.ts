/**
 * React Query Client Configuration with Async Persistence
 *
 * 2026 Best Practice: "Flash-Load" Pattern
 * - Data displayed from cache within 50ms on app start
 * - Background refresh happens after cached data is shown
 * - 24-hour cache retention for offline resilience
 *
 * Reliability note (Android startup):
 * - We intentionally use AsyncStorage (async) instead of MMKV (sync) here
 *   for query persistence.
 * - Some Android users reported startup hangs on the animated splash screen.
 * - Sync storage hydration can block the JS thread during app bootstrap.
 * - Cache restore/subscription is also deferred until after splash exit in
 *   `QueryProvider` to keep startup work off the critical render path.
