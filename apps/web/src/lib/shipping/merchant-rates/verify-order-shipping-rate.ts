/**
 * Order-time server-side verification for merchant-configured shipping rates.
 *
 * When a checkout order carries a `shipping_rate_id`, /api/orders must never
 * trust the client-submitted `shipping_fee`. This helper re-derives the fee
 * authoritatively from the merchant's rate config:
 *   1. load the merchant's zones/locations/rates through the storefront RPC
 *      (service-role client — the tables have no anon grants), failing LOUD:
 *      a load error throws `MerchantShippingRatesLoadError` rather than reading
 *      as an empty rate set (see the return-contract note below),
 *   2. confirm the selected rate exists, is active, and belongs to an active
 *      zone of THIS merchant (a foreign rate id simply won't be in the load),
 *   3. confirm that zone is the MOST-SPECIFIC match for the destination —
 *      a rate from a non-winning zone is rejected, so a shopper cannot pick
 *      the cheap Lagos rate while shipping to Abuja,
 *   4. recompute the fee via the same engine the quotes API uses
 *      (tier bounds + free-over-threshold against the canonical subtotal).
 *
 * Destination resolution — the DOMESTIC ASSUMPTION: checkout collects no
 * country field today (free-text state only), so when the shipping address
 * has no valid ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country we fall back to the merchant's own
 * country (`merchants.country`) and treat the order as domestic. A present,
 * valid ISO-2 address country always wins over the fallback.
 *
 * Verification VERDICTS are returned as a typed result so the money-path route
 * can map rejections to precise 400 codes. A LOAD failure is different: if the
 * merchant's rate config cannot be loaded (RPC / DB / schema-cache error) this
 * throws `MerchantShippingRatesLoadError` instead of returning an empty
 * payload, so the route surfaces a server outage as a 500 rather than a bogus
 * customer-facing 400 invalid-rate. A successful load with zero rates is still
 * a normal verdict (rejected as an invalid rate, 400).
