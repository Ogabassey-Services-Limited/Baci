 * (`generateSlug` emits `[\w-]`, production maxes out near ~106 chars) and the
 * internal preflight routes already reject anything above 255 chars, so an
 * over-long or repeatedly-encoded slug can never resolve to a product. Judging
 * such input unsafe BEFORE it reaches internal preflight fetches or `'use
 * cache'`/Supabase lookups keeps unbounded attacker-controlled keys out of the
 * request/cache pipeline (the source of `UND_ERR_SOCKET` unhandled-rejection
 * crashes) without changing how normal valid or invalid slugs resolve.
 *
 * The gate only judges — it never rewrites the slug or throws on malformed
 * percent-encoding. Callers keep using their original value when it is safe.
