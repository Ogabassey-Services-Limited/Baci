 * Provider chain for image-INPUT tasks (OCR, logo color extraction, photo
 * price-list parsing). Same order as the text chain, minus providers that
 * cannot accept image parts (Groq gpt-oss-120b) and the opportunistic
 * OpenRouter pool (429-contended; never worth a vision retry).
 *
 * Callers must send images as raw bytes (Uint8Array/Buffer), NOT remote URLs:
 * Cerebras only accepts base64 data URIs, and the AI SDK passes URL parts
 * through verbatim to OpenAI-compatible providers instead of downloading
 * them. Image generation is NOT covered here — no chain provider besides
 * Gemini can produce images, so image-output features stay on
 * `activeImageModel` from ./provider.
