# Atlas Notes

## 2026-06-28 — Shared Intl currency formatting for mobile admin totals

**Learning:** `Intl.NumberFormat` should be the shared source for currency display so locale, symbol placement, grouping, and fallback behavior stay consistent across markets. Avoid isolated `en-NG` formatter caches in components/helpers.
**Action:** Route mobile-admin totals through the shared `formatCurrency` utility and validate merchant currency codes before formatting.

## 2026-07-01 — Storefront purchase history should use merchant currency

**Learning:** Hardcoded `Intl.NumberFormat('en-NG', { currency: 'NGN' })` in storefront components creates market-readiness drift when merchant context already exposes centralized country/payout currency formatting.
**Action:** Use the storefront `useCurrency()` hook for purchase-history prices and cover the delegation with a colocated regression test.
