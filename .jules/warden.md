## 2024-05-24 - Missing Query Scoping in Product Reviews
**Learning:** Checking ownership of a resource in application code using `merchantContext.merchantId !== review.merchant_id` is insufficient for robust data integrity. Query builder methods like `.update()` and `.delete()` must also be explicitly scoped with `.eq('merchant_id', ...)` to prevent race conditions or app-logic bypasses.
**Action:** Always append `.eq('merchant_id', merchantId)` to all database mutations (`.update()`, `.delete()`, `.upsert()`) to ensure defense-in-depth, even if application-level checks are present.

## 2025-05-24 - Prevent `select('*')` Overfetching in Customer Searches

**Learning:** Using `select('*')` when checking for existing customers overfetches all columns, increasing payload size and query execution time unnecessarily.
**Action:** Always specify exact columns needed (like `id, first_name, last_name, email, phone, address`) instead of `*` for database reads to improve performance and prevent unintended data exposure.

## 2025-02-27 - Unhandled Errors in maybeSingle / single Queries
**Learning:** Destructuring `{ data }` from `supabase.from().single()` or `maybeSingle()` without checking for the `error` object causes silent failures. If `.single()` expects 0 rows, it incorrectly throws a PGRST116 error that could be swallowed. On the flip side, real database errors on `.maybeSingle()` are ignored if `error` is unchecked, allowing dependent logic to proceed with `data = null` improperly, leading to data integrity issues.
**Action:** Always extract and handle `error` explicitly when fetching data. Use `.maybeSingle()` when 0 rows is valid, and handle true database errors distinctly from the 0-rows case.

## 2026-05-24 - Missing Query Scoping in Transaction Updates
**Learning:** When performing updates on resources like transactions, even if the user has been authenticated and the transaction has been fetched using a gateway reference, the subsequent `.update()` call using the record's ID must still explicitly include `.eq('merchant_id', merchantId)`. Relying solely on the ID or prior fetched data creates a vulnerability if an attacker can manipulate IDs or references.
**Action:** Always append `.eq('merchant_id', merchantId)` to all database mutations (`.update()`, `.delete()`, `.upsert()`) to ensure multi-tenant isolation, regardless of whether the target record's ID was obtained securely.

## 2026-06-02 - Missing Tenant Isolation in Order Updates
**Learning:** Even when modifying data derived from a known entity (like an `order_id`), Supabase `.update()` calls can act as IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) vectors if not explicitly scoped by `merchant_id`. In `record-payment`, the order status was being updated purely by `id`, which could allow a malicious user to modify another tenant's order status if they guess the ID.
**Action:** ALWAYS chain `.eq('merchant_id', merchantId)` onto database mutations (`.update()`, `.delete()`), even when selecting by the record's primary key (`.eq('id', id)`). This ensures defense-in-depth against cross-tenant data modification.
## 2026-06-05 - Missing merchant_id scope in negotiation updates
**Learning:** Updates to the `negotiation_requests` table lacked `.eq('merchant_id', merchant.id)` scoping. Although it checked `id`, omitting `merchant_id` could allow a cross-tenant data leak if an attacker somehow guesses another merchant's negotiation request ID. RLS is a defense line, but application code should always defensively scope updates to the authenticated context.
**Action:** Always append `.eq('merchant_id', merchant.id)` when executing mutations (`.update()`, `.delete()`, `.insert()`) on tenant-specific tables to enforce defense-in-depth tenant isolation.
## 2026-06-11 - Silent Failure on Supabase Mutations
**Learning:** Performing a Supabase mutation (like `.delete()`) and logging the error without returning a failure response can lead to inconsistent state and silent failures, where the application incorrectly assumes success and proceeds with dependent operations.
**Action:** Always check the `error` object returned from Supabase mutations and explicitly return an error response (e.g., `500`) to halt execution and signal the failure to the client.
2026-06-16 — Supabase .single() Silent Failure
Learning: When using `.single()` in Supabase on a query that might return 0 rows (like looking up an existing push token for a new device), Supabase returns `{ data: null, error: { code: 'PGRST116' } }`. If the code ignores the `error` object and only checks `if (data)`, it proceeds correctly for 0 rows, BUT it also silently proceeds if there's a genuine database failure (like a connection timeout), hiding the real error.
Action: Use `.maybeSingle()` when 0 or 1 rows are expected, and explicitly check `if (error)` to catch genuine database failures.

2026-06-19 — [Validation of API Route Bodies]
Learning: Blindly type-casting the request body in an API route bypasses runtime safety and creates a data-integrity risk.
Action: Always use Zod `safeParse` to validate the incoming API payload against a defined schema and return a 400 error if it fails, instead of type casting.

YYYY-MM-DD — Missing Error Check on Single Fetch
Learning: When calling `.single()` without destructuring and checking the `error` property from a Supabase query, genuine database failures (like connection issues or missing rows) fail silently and allow execution to continue using potentially undefined or null data, masking the failure and leading to corrupt state logic. Furthermore, `.single()` will throw a PostgREST error if no rows are found, which is dangerous if unhandled.
Action: Always destructure and check `error` (e.g., `const { data, error } = ...`) for every Supabase query. When 0 rows is a possibility, use `.maybeSingle()` instead of `.single()` to avoid unhandled exceptions, and then check `error`.
